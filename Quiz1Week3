1. There will be an object called 'iris' in your workspace. In this dataset, what is the mean of 'Sepal.Length' for the species virginica? Please round your answer to the nearest whole number.
tapply(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean)
7

2. apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, mean)

3. with(mtcars, tapply(mpg, cyl, mean))
sapply(split(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl), mean)
tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean)

4. x <- sapply(split(mtcars$hp, mtcars$cyl), mean)
x[1]-x[3]
127

5. Execution of 'ls' will suspend at the beginning of the function and you will be in the browser.
